# Sales Forecasting Using Linear Regression â€“ Superstore Dataset

## Project Overview

This project presents a linear regression-based approach to forecasting future monthly sales using a retail Superstore dataset. It covers the entire data analytics pipelineâ€”from preprocessing and feature engineering to model development and visualization. The primary goal is to provide actionable sales predictions that support strategic planning and business decision-making.

---

## Objective

To forecast the next six months of sales by leveraging historical transaction data. The model is designed to help businesses anticipate demand, allocate resources effectively, and optimize revenue generation strategies.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: Retail Superstore dataset (CSV format)
- **Key Variables**:
  - `Order Date`: Date of each transaction
  - `Sales`: Revenue generated
- **Derived Features**:
  - `YearMonth`: Extracted from order dates for time-series aggregation
  - `MonthNumber`: Sequential numeric representation of months for regression input

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and parsed the dataset using `pandas`
- Converted `Order Date` to datetime format
- Checked for data consistency and formatting issues

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created `YearMonth` for monthly aggregation
- Aggregated total monthly sales for trend analysis
- Introduced `MonthNumber` as a numeric independent variable

### 3. Model Building
- Used **Linear Regression** from `scikit-learn` to model the relationship between month number and sales
- Trained the model on historical monthly sales data

### 4. Forecasting
- Predicted sales for the next six months using the fitted model
- Printed and visualized future forecasted values

### 5. Data Visualization
- Line plot comparing actual vs. forecasted monthly sales
- Bar chart for yearly sales comparison
- Scatter plot with regression trend line for monthly sales
